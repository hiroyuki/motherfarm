**openframeworks** addon of libartnet - only for OS X 10.7 and above.

**Libartnet** is an implementation of the ArtNet protocol. ArtNet allows the
transmission of DMX and related data over IP networks.

##warning
 
* The nords subnet and universe is currently fixed to 0x01
* The addon is used with enttec ODE. But I suppose this will work with other artnet devices
